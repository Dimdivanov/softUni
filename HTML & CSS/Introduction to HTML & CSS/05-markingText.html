        <h1>Separation of concerns</h1>
        <p>
            In
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>,
            <strong>separation of concerns</strong> (sometimes abbreviated as SoC)
            <em
                >is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct
                sections </em
            >. Each section addresses a separate concern, a set of information that
            affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as "the
            details of the hardware for an application", or as specific as "the name of
            which class to instantiate". A program that embodies
            <abbr title="">SoC</abbr> well is called a modular[1] program. Modularity, and
            hence separation of concerns, is achieved by encapsulating information inside
            a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means
            of information hiding.[2] Layered designs in information systems are another
            embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic
            layer, data access layer, persistence layer).[3]
